Meta has been hit with a US$275 million fine [for violating European privacy rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/28/business/meta-fine-eu-privacy.html), after a data breach discovered last year led to the personal information of more than 500 million Facebook users being leaked online. The penalty, imposed by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, brings the total amount Meta has been fined by European regulators over the past 15 months to more than $900 million. [In September](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/meta-fined-400-million-over-privacy-5428828/), the Irish watchdog fined Meta $400 million for mishandling children’s data on Instagram; in October 2021, it was fined $235 million for violations related to WhatsApp.
