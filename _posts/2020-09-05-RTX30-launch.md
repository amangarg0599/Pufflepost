Recently Nvidia announced their new flagship series graphic card called RTX 30 Series.  They’re powered by Ampere that is the what they are calling their newer architecture. With their market release as close to September, when these puppies will be available in the market they will surely bring the storm to the market.

That is because even their lowest end graphic card in the newer range is more powerful then the mightiest graphic card (RTX1080Ti) of the last generation which is something that almost nobody expected. If speculation is right RTX 3070 will cost as low as 499$ or ₹51,000. This price is so competitive that it has made the current gen graphics card absolutely obsolete in terms of pricing .The RTX2080ti founders edition cost almost a lakh in India which will made them loose their more than 50% value immediately and enthusiasts who have just built their PC may find this maddening.

## The improvements in the newer gen graphics card include - 

- PCIe Gen4 which will provide more bandwidth to graphics card.
-  Newer GDDR6x memory that will be faster than the current GDDR6 memory
- Almost as twice as CUDA cores as compared to previous generation

The complete Technical specifications are given below-

|                    | **GeForce RTX 3090** | **GeForce RTX 3080** | **GeForce RTX 3070** |
| :----------------: | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
|     CUDA Cores     | 10,496               | 8,704                | 5,888                |
|        VRAM        | 24 GB GDDR6X         | 10 GB GDDR6X         | 8 GB GDDR6           |
| Prices Starting At | $1499/**Rs.152,000** | $699/**Rs.71,000**   | $499/**Rs.51,000**   |
|    Release Date    | September 24         | September 17         | Available October    |

If we go on Nvidia wordings these graphics card will be almost 2X than the previous generation, this means that Nvidia is serious about flexing their muscles in graphic industry. Also this move was precedented seeing condition of Intel in the processor market due to the tough competition given by AMD Ryzen that has given tough competition to the Intel at even lower price with even better features, If Nvidia wanted to maintain its supremacy in the graphics card world it had to take this kind of step to kill all the competition. And with no surprise there is no competition in that range from team AMD even in this range. Right now Nvidia is providing a better value proposition in every way with their new cards.

## Design- 

One of best things about these graphics cards is the better design even in the founder's edition. Although I was never a fan of the founder edition design but this generation cards sure have a sexy appeal to them.

Even the Newer hybrid chamber for air intake and outtake is smart this solution will definitely keep the card cooler to maintain better performance. Nvidia in their own words describes the fan design as -

> we’ve created an innovative dual axial flow through cooling solution, featuring two fans - one at the left front, and another on the right rear that draws air through the card (the GeForce RTX 3070 flow through design differs slightly, with its fans both mounted on the top of the card).
>
> As heat is drawn away from components into the hybrid vapor chamber, it is efficiently distributed across the length of the card and throughout the massive aluminum fin stack. The left fan pushes air heated by the fin stack out through extra-large GPU bracket vents, while the right fan draws the air towards the top chassis exhaust.

Although the real life performance will only be tested when they are release on **September 17** . But its exciting to see such big jump in performance in a single generation. This jump will be hard to cover for AMD even in coming years. These cards are so powerful that Nvidia is making claims that they will be able to handle 8K/60FPS on major AAA titles. This is a bold claim even for cards like these.

Some other improvements include - 

- 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores & 3rd Generation Tensor Cores
- HDMI 2.1 Support
- AV1 Decode Support
- NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency Technologies
- AI-Powered Voice and Video With the NVIDIA Broadcast App

This plethora of features  has hyped up many tech enthusiasts around the world. Now the only wait is of release of these cards in market  and to see how AMD will react to this major launch
