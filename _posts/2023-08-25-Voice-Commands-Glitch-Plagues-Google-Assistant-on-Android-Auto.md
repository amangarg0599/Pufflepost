Attention all Android Auto users, a frustrating glitch has reared its head! The indispensable feature of voice commands via Google Assistant has hit a snag, leaving users in the lurch while on the road.

In recent days, a growing number of Android Auto users have been grappling with a perplexing issue – voice commands have gone silent. Whether prompted on the screen or through dedicated car buttons, Google Assistant seems to be taking an unscheduled break.

When users attempt voice commands, a disheartening error message echoes back:

"Voice commands aren’t available right now."

This bug seems to be casting its net far and wide, affecting a diverse array of car makes and models, device types, and Android Auto versions. The only commonality? Timing. The majority of grievances have flooded in over the past 48 hours, with a notable surge in the last few.

Numerous reports have popped up across Google’s community forums and even on Reddit, cementing the scope of this annoyance. A potential glimmer of hope shines through, as some users have stumbled upon a temporary remedy. By reverting to an older version of the Google app, the problem appears to dissipate. In particular, version 14.34.19.29 of the app, accessible via the beta program, holds the key. Uninstalling recent updates via the Play Store reportedly serves as a Band-Aid solution.

As the Android Auto community rallies against this voice command mishap, stay tuned for updates and possible fixes. In the meantime, keep your eyes on the road and your frustration in check!
