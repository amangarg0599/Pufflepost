Thin and light laptops focus on productivity rather than raw gaming performance.  it includes browsing chrome, using office, photoshop, and light video editing. Today we will be reviewing Vivobook Pro Oled 14 AMD ryzen variant. It has decent performance and good specs according to the cost.

# The Good
For the money, it has some pretty good specifications but some of these are the highlights.
## Display

The most impressive aspect is definitely the display. The 2.4K OLED display is stunning and is the most appealing part of the laptop. The colors are vibrant and balanced. It has 100% DCI P3 coverage, making it suitable for media consumption and light photo editing. Also, 600 nits OLED panels will make your older laptops feel antique compared to this panel.

## Performance.
There are several variants available for this laptop ( particularly the M3400 series).

| Variant                                    | Price            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Ryzen 5600H, 8 Gb Ram, 512GB SSD           | ₹56,990- ₹59,990 |
| Ryzen 5800H, 16 Gb Ram, 512GB SSD          | ₹59,990- ₹65,990 |

The price of the laptop is variable but if you get the laptop in under a lower price it will be a stunning deal. from the two variants, you should definitely go for the higher one, as it will be more future-proof.

## Trackpad and keyboard

The trackpad provided is a glass one and supports clicking all around. It supports all modern gestures such as two three and four-finger swipes.

 The keyboard is also good with backlit and adjustable dimming levels it is easy to get used to. You will find the keys clicky and tactile. The power button doubles as a fingerprint sensor and allows a quick start to the laptop.

# The Bad
## The ports

One of the biggest downsides of the laptop is the ports. There is no "USB-C" in this laptop which is the biggest surprise for a 2022 mid-range laptop. There is no logical sense to not include this port today.

Although it has a USB 3.1 port it is only 'Type A" and other than that there is only presence of two "USB 2 "ports. Other ports include HDMI, Micro SD, and a combined headphone microphone jack. Nonetheless to say the port situation on this laptop is unimpressive.

## Bezels


Although the bezels are not huge they are not small either, and also not pretty. The plastic stares you in the eve every time you see the display. It is more of nitpicking but if you will notice you will find it pretty annoying.
# Conclusion

This is a well-balanced laptop for the price point. It has some decent specs such as a good processor, plenty of RAM, and a stunning display. The only notable con is the lack of a USB-C port. If you want a portable 14-inch thin and light this will be an excellent choice.
